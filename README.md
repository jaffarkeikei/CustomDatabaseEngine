# Custom Database Engine

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple yet functional Custom Mini Database Engine using C++. It is designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data stored in files, offering a hands-on approach to understanding fundamental computer science principles, data structures, algorithms, and file handling in C++.

### Core Features

- **Data Storage**: Utilizes a file-based storage system with each table stored in a separate CSV file for simplicity.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting records within the database through parsing input commands and modifying files.
- **Query Processing**: Features a simple query language or command interface for database interaction, including commands like `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- **Indexing**: Implements a basic indexing mechanism using a simple B-tree or hash table to enhance search operations.

### Possibly Deffered Features

- **Concurrency Control**: Includes basic locking mechanisms to handle multiple users or processes accessing the database simultaneously.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforces constraints such as primary keys and unique columns to maintain data integrity.
- **Join Operations**: Supports basic join operations between tables.
- **Caching**: Features a simple cache system for storing frequently accessed data in memory.

## Why This Project Is Impressive

- **Complexity and Simplicity**: Demonstrates the ability to manage both comprehensive and detailed aspects of software development.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Provides insight into the fundamental role of databases in software development.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Involves significant problem-solving in areas like storage format design and search algorithm implementation.
- **C++ Mastery**: Showcases proficiency in C++ through object-oriented programming, file handling, data structures, and more.
